# E-commerce Back End

## Description

Built the back end for an e-commerce site.  Taking a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. E-commerce site solves the problem of getting, deleting and setting data from a MYSQL database to a express application. I learned how to use routes to get information and create CRUD routes.
